## This is a test of building a react / webRTC communication layer

This is currently a test app - not great code, etc. There are some errors being thrown right now and other things that are less than ideal. . .

## install

`npm install` || `yarn install`

## running

`npm start` || `yarn start`

## references

It is based on the excellent simple-datachannel (git project) [https://github.com/JustGoscha/simple-datachannel] (blog post)[http://www.justgoscha.com/programming/2014/03/07/simple-webrtc-datachannel-establishment-for-dummies.html]

It is made with create react app BUT I wouldn't see anything in here as a good React practice.
